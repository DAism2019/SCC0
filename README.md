# What is the Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) license?
Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) is not only the first public goods license designed for decentralized public applications (Smart Commons), which includes dApps, dAIpps (decentralized AI application), and various types of AIs, but also the first license which could be verified when an smart common interacting with another one.
# Background
##  Code is law: a brief intro of smart contracts.
A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, this specific address is a type of Ethereum account, which is Contract Account (CA). This means every contract account have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. A "smart contract" cannot be deleted or modified, and interactions with it are irreversible. Moreover, smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain could be executable forever.

Therefore, smart contracts are the best executors of the principle that code is law.

## 
All dApps or dAIpps, by virtue of the nature of smart contracts, have a state variable called "owner" in their code. This variable stores the Externally Owned Account (EOA, commonly known as a wallet address), or a multi-signature address (also controlled by the wallet addresses of all its members) of the contract's owner.  This address is usually set by the deployer during contract deployment or updated through a specific function during contract operation. Its purpose is to implement the contract's permission control, ensuring that only specific addresses (usually the contract's deployer, manager, a certain team, or even an AI) can execute certain sensitive operations.

We know that, according to the corresponding cryptographic principles, the actual control of a wallet address lies solely with its private key. The private key is never and cannot be made public. However, private keys can be secretly shared among several people. Therefore, who, or which people, actually control a wallet address cannot be verified or disproved.

Up to this point, essentially, Externally Owned Accounts are all anonymous accounts. No matter what you do, it is impossible to establish a reliable relationship of ownership with anyone's real-name identity. Therefore, dApps or dAIpps based on smart contracts are all anonymous applications.

In terms of development, this anonymity mechanism brings some advantages that real-name mechanisms cannot match. The most prominent aspect is that due to anonymity, in the ongoing development and use of dApps/dAIpps, no one can prove their ownership of any rights related to them, nor can anyone prove who bears any responsibilities associated with them. The most valuable feature of this anonymity is that it allows us to establish the first public license in human history: Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0). In short, adhering to the SCC0 license means that the development and ownership of the dApp or dAIpp will not be linked to anyone's real identity, thus becoming a pure decentralized public application.

We refer to dApps or dAIpps that follow the SCC0 license as Smart Commons. Smart Commons are decentralized public applications.

## What will be added in the future

* **dApp vs. dAIpp**: You might want to clarify the distinction between dApp (decentralized application) and dAIpp (decentralized AI application) in your English text, as the difference might not be immediately clear to all readers.
* **EOA**: Consider briefly explaining what an EOA is for readers who might not be familiar with the term.
* **Multi-signature address**: Similarly, a brief explanation of how a multi-signature address works could be helpful.
