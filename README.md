# What is the Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) license?
Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) is not only the first public goods license designed for decentralized public applications (Smart Commons), which includes dApps, dAIpps (decentralized AI application), and various types of AIs, but also the first license which could be verified when an smart common interacting with another one.
# Background
##  Code is law: a brief intro of smart contracts.
A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, this specific address is a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. A "smart contract" cannot be deleted or modified but runnable forever by default, and interactions with it are irreversible. Moreover, smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain are executable forever.
Therefore, smart contracts are the best executors of the principle that code is law.

## 
All dApps or dAIpps, by virtue of the nature of smart contracts, have a state variable called "owner" in their code. This variable stores the external account (EOA), commonly known as a wallet address, or a multi-signature address, of the contract's owner. The multi-signature address is also controlled by the wallet addresses of all its members. This address is usually set by the deployer during contract deployment or updated through a specific function during contract operation. Its purpose is to implement the contract's permission control, ensuring that only specific addresses (usually the contract's deployer, manager, a certain team, or even an AI) can execute certain sensitive operations.

We know that, according to the corresponding cryptographic principles, the actual control of a wallet address lies solely with its private key. The private key is never and cannot be made public. However, private keys can be secretly shared among several people. Therefore, who, or which people, actually control a wallet address cannot be verified or disproved.

Up to this point, essentially, external accounts are all anonymous accounts. No matter what you do, it is impossible to establish a reliable relationship of ownership with anyone's real-name identity. Therefore, dApps or dAIpps based on smart contracts are all anonymous applications.

In terms of development, this anonymity mechanism brings some advantages that real-name mechanisms cannot match. Looking towards the future, we believe that the most valuable point is that it allows us to formulate the first public license in human history: Smart Creative Commons Zero. Abbreviated as SCC0.

Following the SCC0 license means that the dApp or dAIpp will be unrelated to anyone and become a decentralized public application. We call dApps or dAIpps that follow the SCC0 license Smart Commons.

## What will be added in the future

* **dApp vs. dAIpp**: You might want to clarify the distinction between dApp (decentralized application) and dAIpp (decentralized AI application) in your English text, as the difference might not be immediately clear to all readers.
* **EOA**: Consider briefly explaining what an EOA is for readers who might not be familiar with the term.
* **Multi-signature address**: Similarly, a brief explanation of how a multi-signature address works could be helpful.
