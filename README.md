# What is the Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) license?
Smart Creative Commons Zero (SCC0) is not only the first public goods license designed for decentralized public applications (Smart Commons), which includes dApps, dAIpps, and various types of AIs, but also the first license which could be verified when an smart common interacting with another one.
# Background
A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, this specific address is a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. A "smart contract" cannot be deleted or modified but runnable forever by default, and interactions with it are irreversible.
